# Project-Yumi-Yumi

## Search Page

Hi team, this is my mockup for the search page, in the logo I use 3 different icons provided by ionic that I think match with the title of the project(food).

## Subject to improve:

-I'm not sure about the colors but we can check it later.
-I added 2 buttons to mark the recipe to favorite and the youtube link. Any comments?
-I'm not sure either about the add and search for the recipe, we can discuss it later to improve and to start with the functionality.

## User Story
